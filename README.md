# Game Config Vault

A personal repository for organizing and tracking game configurations, mod lists, settings, and other related notes for various games. Each game has its own dedicated folder containing relevant files such as mod lists, configuration details, and personal documentation to enhance gameplay experiences.

## Structure
/game-name/: Folder for each game (e.g., rdr2, skyrim).
- modlist.txt: List of mods used for the game.
- settings.ini or similar: Game-specific settings or configurations.
- notes.md: Additional notes, tips, or personal documentation.

## Purpose

This repo serves as a centralized hub to:

- Keep track of mods and their configurations for easy reference or reinstallation.
- Store game settings for optimal performance or preferred gameplay.
- Document personal insights, tweaks, or plans for each game.

Feel free to explore the folders for specific games or use this as a template for your own game configurations!
